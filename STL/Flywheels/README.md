# Flywheel Choice

Choose which flywheel to print based off your motor. We ship bundles and blasters with Lumenier LX2205 motors. These are identical in size to the RX2205 which the wheels were based on but purple instead of silver so for FDL-3's #0098+ choose the Lumenier file. FDL-3's prior to #0097 used black Vspec motors with four screws to mount the flywheels. Choose the vspec file for those. The EMAX file is for a motor that was going to be used but never was. It is there for historical purposes. Spacers are only required for the EMAX version and can be ignored. Flywheels for the HIR nose are different but labeled as such.

# Printing

Flywheels must be printed balanced and strong but also light weight. Here are a few suggestions for how to do so. 

- We use common 0.4mm nozzles at 0.2mm layer heights. If using a different size, adjust accordingly.
- 0.2mm layer or lower layer height
- We currently print all wheels in ABS. It is extremely heat resistant, impact tolerant and less dense than PLA or PETG thus lighter. It requires an enclosure around your printer and some care to get right but we found it to be our favorite flywheel material. It's also easy to machine for balancing purposes.
- PLA can be used for flywheels with some caveats. Given the short time and ease of use, those caveats may be more or less important in your situation. It can be susceptible to warping under heavy or summer time use but is stronger than PETG in this use. It also fails in a safe way by splitting at layer seams. Good luck getting that to happen though.
- PETG can be weak and shatter if not printed properly. It's higher heat resistance can help warping but use it at your own risk to avoid shattered flywheels, ouch.
- Use 3-4 perimeters. 3 can lead to lighter wheels but 4 will be reliably stronger. We use 4.
- Infill should be roughly 20%, rectilinear, rotated vertical/horizontal instead of the typical 45 degrees and centered on the wheel.
- Layer seams (called different things in different slicers) should be randomized to avoid a heavy side where all the seams line up. Slicers will typically hide these seams in corners. We want them scattered randomly. A "zitted" appearance is normal and can help grip on darts.
- Target roughly 10 gram weight per wheel. Heavier have more inertia and could potentially perform better but are more susceptible to imbalance and sluggish feel. Lighter are less susceptible to imbalance and quieter but provide less momentum.
- Not all flywheels printed in this manner will be perfect. A propeller balancer can be used to balance wheels or you can print multiples and choose the best two.

Good luck and make on!
